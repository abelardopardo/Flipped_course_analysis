* Effect of personalised feedback messages from analytics

This study seeks to see the effect of sending personalised emails to students at certain times during a course based on the data collected through learning analytics techniques.

The main experience was the deployment of these messages in a course in 2015. Both the student satisfaction with the feedback (through the course survey) and the scores are analysed.
