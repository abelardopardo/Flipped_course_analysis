## ADD STUDY STRATEGIES
## - these are identified by building a HMM using the studentsâ€™ study sessions 
##   in the entire course; the strategies are the distinct states of the built HMM
## - each learning session (all events within a session) is associate with one 
##   study strategy 
## - strategies are identified for weeks 2-5 and 7-12, that is, weeks 6 and 13 
##   are skipped as those are the weeks when students prepared for the exams and 
##   their behaviour deviates from the regular study behaviour; so, sessions from
##   weeks 6 and 13 do not have associated study strategies
